\section{MicroTAS proceeding papers}
\label{Appendice_MicroTASpaper}

MicroTAS or \textmu TAS (standing for micro total analysis systems) is annual conference series that are the premier forum for reporting research results in microfluidics, microfabrication, nanotechnology, integration, materials and surfaces, analysis and synthesis, and detection technologies for life science and chemistry. The Conference offers plenary talks as well as contributed oral presentations and posters selected from submitted abstracts. This year, the Twenty Third \textmu TAS 2019 will be held at the Congress Center Basel, in Basel, Switzerland from 27-31 October, 2019.

\subsection{Proceeding paper feature}
Every year about 700 abstracts are accepted. Proceedings papers are 4 pages paper with title, authors names and affiliations, keywords and regular sections such as abstract, main, results, conclusions and references. However these section labels are sometimes not respected by the authors and consequently complicated for text extraction.
