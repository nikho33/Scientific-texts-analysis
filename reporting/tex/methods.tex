%\chapter{Methods}

The main source of machine-interpretable data for the materials research community has come from structured property databases. Beyond property values, publications contain valuable knowledge regarding the connections and relationships between data items as interpreted by the authors. To improve the identification and use of this knowledge, several studies have focused on the retrieval of information from scientific literature using supervised natural language processing3â€“10, which requires large hand-labelled datasets for training.
