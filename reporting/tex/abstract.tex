	The project is part of the "formation" Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) held at Sorbonne University (Paris, France) during 2018-2019 academic year. As final homework, a work on the analysis and classification of scientific texts have been chosen. 
	\newline
	Initial motivations of the student were to discover and learn mathematical algorithms and methods used in AI and ML in order to evaluate any application for the Fluigent project HoliFAB, which in part aim at optimizing microfluidic system layout. First works on this point led to the implementation of linear and non-linear regression functions.

	However the motivation of the student for the current project raises from the frustration as a researcher to not be able to read and study all relevant papers of a field. Making a bibliography on specific topic is common and easy to perform thanks to different database and search engine available on the internet. However, when it comes to study a broad scientific field for a global understanding or new research investigation or market analysis, it is
